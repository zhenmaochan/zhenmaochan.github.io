<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at CIAI (Central China Institute of Artificial Intelligence)  as a researcher now in Zhengzhou.

I am now working on LLM inference acceleration and AI4Science research, advised by Ming Li (李明).

I graduated from University of Science and Technology of China with a master’s degree, advised by Tao Luo (罗涛) and Xuebin Li (李学彬). 

I won the “Yuet Kwan” Merit Scholarship (悦群品学兼优奖学金)(2%) in 2023 and was selected as Provincial Outstanding Graduates in USTC (安徽省优秀毕业生) (4%).

My research interest includes LLM inference acceleration and AI4Science. I have published 2 papers at the international academic journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OmiXteIAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>10+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OmiXteIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhenmaochan/zhenmaochan.github.io@google-scholar-stats/gs_data_shieldsio.json&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

- A new visibility prediction method based on stacking fusion model (VSFM) was established.
- Predicted visibility using meteorological and pollutant concentrations with the accuracy of up to 93%.
- Help to deepen the understanding of visibility influencing factors under complex urban pollution sources and improve the visibility prediction for bottom visibility scenarios under heavy pollution.
